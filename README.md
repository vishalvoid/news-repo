Project Requirement – Worldwide News Aggregator
1. Project Overview
We want to create a Worldwide News Aggregator web application that collects and displays news from across the globe.
The main goal is to have a visually stunning, eye-pleasing, and modern interface that is easy to use and attractive for viewers.
No backend will be created for this project — instead, it will directly fetch news from free public news APIs and display them in a clean, well-structured layout.

2. Purpose
The purpose of this project is to provide users with a single platform to explore the latest headlines, news by country, and news by category, with an option to search specific topics — all in a beautiful, smooth, and engaging experience.

3. Core Features
a. Homepage – Top Headlines
Show the latest top headlines from around the world.

Each news item should appear in a card format with:

Image (thumbnail)

Headline (title)

Short summary/description

Source name

Publish date & time

Button to read the full article (opens in a new tab)

b. Country Selection
Dropdown or selection menu to choose a country (e.g., India, USA, UK, Japan, Australia, etc.).

Selecting a country updates the news feed instantly to show that country’s headlines.

c. Category Selection
Options for categories such as:

General

Business

Sports

Technology

Entertainment

Health

Science

Clicking on a category shows relevant news in that category.

d. Search Function
A search bar to look for specific news topics.

Search results should appear in the same card format as the homepage.

e. Pagination or “Load More”
Option to load more articles when reaching the bottom of the page or by clicking a button.

4. User Experience & Layout Requirements
Sidebar Navigation:

A fixed or collapsible sidebar for easy navigation between categories, country selection, and other sections.

Can also include quick links like “Top Headlines”, “My Country News”, “Latest Technology”, etc.

Header / Top Bar:

Contains logo/app name, search bar, and possibly a theme toggle (light/dark mode).

Content Area:

News displayed in cards/grid view with images, headlines, and summaries.

Cards have hover effects, shadows, and animations for a premium feel.

Footer:

Minimal footer with app info or credits.

Component-Based UI:

Reusable visual components such as:

News Card

Search Bar

Category Tabs

Country Selector

Pagination or Load More button

Visual Enhancements:

Subtle animations (fade-in, slide-in) when news loads.

Consistent spacing and padding for a clean, breathable design.

5. API Usage
Fetch news directly from free news APIs.

API key will be added directly in the project (since no backend is used).

Data is fetched and displayed directly in the browser.

6. Pages/Sections
Home – Default top headlines with country and category filters.

Search Results – Shows search-specific news results.

(Optional) About/Info Page – A simple static page describing the app.

7. Constraints
No backend or database — client-side only.

Must be built to run smoothly without complex setup.

All focus should be on user interface, simplicity, and attractiveness.

8. Future Possibilities (Not required now, but possible later)
Dark mode toggle.

Save/bookmark news for later.

Multiple language support.

If you hand this exact requirement to a developer, they’ll know you want:

A purely client-side project.

A very good-looking UI with a sidebar, multiple reusable components, and smooth design.

Minimal complexity, but high visual appeal.

If you want, I can now turn this into your Word report’s “Requirement Analysis” chapter so it’s ready for your submission without extra rewriting. That way, it will be 100% aligned with what the developer is building.
