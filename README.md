Build a production-ready, modern news aggregation website using Next.js, Tailwind CSS for styling, and Framer Motion for smooth animations.

Key Requirements:

News Aggregation:

Fetch and display news articles from multiple free news APIs around the world.

Implement server-side fetching for SEO-friendly content.

Ensure API keys are handled securely via environment variables.

Categorical Display:

Organize news articles into clear categories such as World, Politics, Technology, Sports, Entertainment, Business, Science, Health, Lifestyle, and Trending.

Allow category-based navigation via a top navigation bar or sidebar.

Modern UI/UX:

Fully responsive design for mobile, tablet, and desktop.

Clean, minimal, and visually appealing UI using Tailwind CSS.

Use Framer Motion for smooth page transitions, hover animations, and element fade-ins.

Features:

Search bar to search across news articles.

Infinite scroll or pagination for loading more articles.

Dark mode toggle with state persistence.

Display article thumbnails, headlines, publication date, and source name.

Clicking an article opens a dedicated article page with the full content and related articles.

Performance & SEO:

Use Next.js Image optimization for thumbnails.

Pre-render and cache pages where possible.

Add proper meta tags, Open Graph tags, and structured data for SEO.

Deployment Ready:

Code should be clean, modular, and maintainable.

Include .env.example for environment variables.

Include a README.md with setup instructions.

Prepare it for deployment on Vercel.

Optional nice-to-have:

Show live breaking news ticker at the top.

Integrate a “Save to Reading List” feature with local storage.

Support multiple languages with i18n.

Make sure the overall design feels like a modern, professional news site (similar to BBC, The Verge, or TechCrunch) but with unique branding.
